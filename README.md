# paw-patrol-game-for-kids

A simple 2D phase game with "Paw Patrol" theme, aimed at childrens.

*************************************************************************************************

This is my first game using the popular game engine Phaser, based at the tutorial "Making your first Phaser game" (https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game) 
and extending it with modern Javascript (coding with ES6, using the CommonJS pattern to split the code into modules, a linter for tests, NPM for manage dependencies and
Gulp for manage tasks)

**************************************************************************************************

Used technologies:

- Javascript (ES6);
- Phaser
- Browserify
- Babel
- Gulp
- JShint
